Input: graph G, nodes of graph G', vertex array nodes
Output: vertex array \xi in G'

for d=1,2,... do
  for v \in nodes do
    set distance d to verteces whose distance from \phi(v) equales to d
  endfor
  if a vertex in G' has distance from \phi(v) for all v \in nodes
  then
    the vertex is called v_star and break from this loop
  endif
endfor
\xi <- { v_star }
for v \in nodes do
  \xi <- \xi \bigcup verteces in the shortest path from a vertex in \xi to a vertex in \phi(v)
endfor
